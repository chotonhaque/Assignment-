 Here's an example of how you can create a Mongoose schema and model for the "Product" collection with the specified fields:



const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define the schema
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  price: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});

// Create the model
const Product = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);

module.exports = Product;
In the above code, we import the mongoose module and define a schema for the "Product" collection. The schema defines the fields and their types, along with any additional properties like required or default.

The name field is of type String and is required, meaning it must have a value. The price field is of type Number and is also required. The description field is of type String and required as well. The createdAt field is of type Date and has a default value of the current date and time when a new product is created.

Finally, we create a model called Product using the defined schema, and export it for use in other parts of the application.

Remember to install the mongoose package if you haven't already by running npm install mongoose in your project directory
